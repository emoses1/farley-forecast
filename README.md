Farley's official weather forecasting. 

Farley's Forecast is a fun take on weather forecasting and the type of weather experienced in Farley's home state, Maryland. If it's not raining, it's snowing (sometimes twice in the same week). Farley's Forecast uses the benefits of the html5 canvas tag, javascript and touch of css to get things going. It is cross browser compatible and truly an in browser 2d experience.


## Getting Started

To get started, you won't need much other than a reliable web browser and a console. Maybe stick with Chrome or Firefox? We won't judge if you test in Chrome canary, but results may vary. Farley's Forecast is programmed as such that it will run with most modern web browsers out there, no other tools required. 

When you launch the game, you will see buttons and animated Farley running across your screen. To  see Farley's Forecast, select the button above the main canvas screen and see what weather Farley has determined you will be having. Farley's forecasting is not comparable with that of WBAL and other local weather stations, but it depends who you ask. 

### Prerequisites

The only things you need are a web browser and a console. If you'd like to see the code up close, you'll want a text editor too. The Farley's Forecast team recommends Atom. 

### Installing

To download the repo and view the project locally, follow these steps:
Open your console, and navigate to the directory where you would like this repo to go.
When ready, copy the cloning link from Github and clone the repository to your local directory.
open index.html in your web browser of choice, and you're there! Start clicking the buttons and trying the effects. 

If for some reason, the cloning is not successful (say your vpn is acting up or your firewall is blocking Github, *gasp*) you may also download the project on your computer with the backup zip file provided by the author. If not provided, contact the code author.
